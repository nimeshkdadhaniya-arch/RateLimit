2. Maven 3.6+


Unit test coverage:
1)Find from  UnitTestConverage.png from src/main/plantuml : Unit and integration  coverage: 92% (instructions) and 78% (branches).
2)Sequence diagram: Find from src/main/plantuml/sequenceDiagram.svg -->rightlick and open in new window
3)Class diagram: Find from src/main/plantuml/classDiagram.svg-->rightlick and open in new window
4)RateLimit ideal solution : in current project redis and rulecache is not implemented. Ratelimit service can be scaled horizontally, Queue is global.
Find from RateLimit_architecture.png

4)How to Run Application:
1)Get postman or any Browser is fine too

To test tokenBucket Algo hit : http://localhost:8082/api/limit?type=TOKEN_BUCKET
To test SlideWindowLog per User hit
For User1: http://localhost:8082/api/limit?type=SLIDING_WINDOW_LOG_USER&key=userid1
Here for user2 :http://localhost:8082/api/limit?type=SLIDING_WINDOW_LOG_USER&key=userid2


Type can be of following values:
  TOKEN_BUCKET -->global ratelimiter only "type" as requestParam is supported
  FIXED_WINDOW-->global ratelimiter only "type" as requestParam is supported
  SLIDING_WINDOW_LOG-->global ratelimiter only "type" as requestParam is supported
